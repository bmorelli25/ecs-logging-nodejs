ECS loggers are formatter plugins for your favorite logging libraries.
They make it easy to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON.

The formatters log structured JSON and support serialization of Error objects,
and HTTP Request and Response objects from Node.js core and popular web
frameworks. A minimal log record includes these fields:
